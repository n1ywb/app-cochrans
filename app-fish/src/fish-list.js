<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Vermont’s only native stream-dwelling trout. Actually a char, they have worm-like markings against a greenish back, and their flanks are covered with light yellowish spots.</p>
<p>Small bright red spots surrounded by blue halos are also found along their lateral mid-section. Their light spots on a dark background distinguish them from brown and rainbow trout. Their tails are also not forked, hence the name "squaretail".</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>One of Vermont’s most-widely dispersed fish, brook trout are found in coldwater fisheries throughout Vermont. They are intolerant of high water temperatures and are seldom found in waters above 68° F.</p>
<p>Some of Vermont’s productive brook trout spots include the White, Cold, Mill, Mettawee, Deerfield and Ottauquechee rivers, though nearly every small, cold stream throughout the state supports a healthy population.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Like other members of the salmonidae family, brook trout can be successfully targeted with both live bait and artificial lures. Live bait selections such as earth worms, wax worms, crickets, small minnows, grasshoppers and fish eggs can all be effective choices for catching brook trout. On the artificial lure side, small spinners, minnow plugs, spoons and various floating and sinking flies are also proven lures.</p>

<strong>State Record:</strong>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The “horned pout” are the most common member of the catfish family in Vermont. They have smooth, olive-brown to dark-brown flanks with a sharp, stout spine on the leading edge of their dorsal and pectoral fins. They have a broad, flat mouth surrounded by six whisker-like barbels.</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Brown bullhead are found in many of the shallower lakes, ponds and rivers throughout Vermont. In contrast to many fish species’, bullhead can thrive in diverse habitats, including bodies of water with muddy conditions and low oxygen levels.</p>
<p>Some popular Vermont bullhead fisheries include lakes Champlain, Memphremagog, Carmi and Hortonia, as well as the Poultney River, Cogman Creek, Connecticut River and Curtis Pond.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Brown bullhead, like other species in the catfish family, are nocturnal bottom feeders. So, while they may sometimes strike moving lures such as spinnerbaits and crankbaits, slow bottom presentations such as jigs, weighted night crawlers, minnows or cut bait fished at night tend to be more successful.</p>
<p>Even better, still-fishing with a rod propped up on a stick is a relaxing, yet effective, technique. Other proven bullhead baits include chopped chicken livers and dough or bread balls.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A true trout that was first brought to Vermont from their native Europe in 1892. They have a light brown overall color, especially in streams, with dark spots intermixed with reddish-orange spots on their flanks, with each spot surrounded by a light halo.</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Distributed in cool to coldwater streams and rivers, as well as coldwater lakes, brown trout can be found throughout Vermont. Next to brook trout, brown trout are the most widely distributed salmonid species in the state.</p>
<p>Some of the state’s premier brown trout fisheries include the Batten Kill, Middlebury, Neshobe, Dog, Castleton and Poultney rivers, Furnace Brook and Otter Creek, and lakes Bomoseen, St. Catherine and Memphramagog.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Both river and lake-dwelling brown trout can be targeted with a wide range of presentations. Brown trout in rivers and streams can consistently be caught with live bait such as night crawlers and small minnows, and with artificial baits including flies, streamers and spinners.</p>
<p>Lake-inhabiting browns are very much the same and can fall for similar live bait selections, as well as to lures like trolled stickbaits and crankbaits.</p>
<p>Lake dwelling brown trout are usually easier to catch in the winter than they are during the summer. Suspending a live baitfish under a tip-up is a good way to target them.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A member of the same family that includes northern pike. However, unlike pike, chain pickerel have fully scaled gill covers, and their tail, dorsal and anal fins have no conspicuous spots or blotches. Their flanks are a light, golden green, with dark, chain-like markings.</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Even more so than northern pike, chain pickerel can be found throughout Vermont in various lakes, ponds and rivers. Though Lake Champlain and many of its tributaries may be the most well-known chain pickerel producers, other fisheries such as Lake Memphremagog, Salem Lake, Connecticut River, Lake Fairlee and Berlin and Salem ponds kick out quality pickerel year in and year out. Many other small ponds around the state also produce surprisingly large chain pickerel.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>As with northern pike, chain pickerel can be consistently found around shallow aquatic vegetation such as milfoil, coontail, pondweed, or lily pads, and can be caught on a wide-range of lures. Everything from spinnerbaits, crankbaits and top water plugs to Texas-rigged plastic worms or jigs have proven to be effective pickerel catchers.</p>
<p>If you’re a live bait angler, perhaps no presentation is more successful for catching numbers of pickerel than suspending live 2 to 4 inch minnows off the bottom with a float or bobber.</p>
<p>In the winter, chain pickerel respond well to a variety of ice fishing jigs and to live minnows fished under tip-ups.</p>

<strong>State Record: </strong>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Lake trout are native to many of Vermont’s deep, cold lakes. Like brook trout, they are actually a char. They have a forked tail, white leading edges on their lower fins, and irregular light spots against a back-ground color that ranges from light olive green to gray.</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Most of Vermont’s top lake trout waters can be found in the Northeast Kingdom. Popular lake trout fisheries in this region include Caspian, Maidstone, and Seymour lakes, as well as Lake Willoughby. However, Lake Champlain is by far the state’s biggest producer of lake trout.</p>
<p>Lake Dunmore and Spring Lake in southwestern Vermont are also stocked with lake trout and provide minor fisheries. Lake trout can also be found in Harriman Reservoir near the Massachusetts border and Echo Lake and Lake Rescue in the southeastern part of the state. In total, 23 Vermont lakes contain lake trout.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Similar to salmon, lake trout can be found in shallow water after ice-out in the spring before moving deeper in the summer. Before water temperatures rise above the low-50’s, try trolling lures such as crankbaits, stickbaits or spoons around shoreline structure and islands.</p>
<p>As the summer progresses and lake trout head into deep water, these same baits must be fished off downriggers, or attached to wire or leadcore lines in order to reach the depths occupied by lake trout. Good depth-finding electronics may be needed to locate and target structure-oriented or suspended deep water trout.</p>
<p>In addition to trolling, jigging buck-tail jigs and spoons is also a proven method for catching deep trout. As waters cool again in the fall, trout can be found migrating towards rocky shorelines and reefs where they typically spawn.</p>
<p>Lake trout can be caught through the ice by jigging spoons and jigs or by fishing live baitfish under tip-ups.</p>

<strong>State Record:</strong>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The same species as sea-going Atlantic salmon, they have a forked tail, silvery flanks, and black spots on the upper half of their body. Unlike lake-dwelling brown trout, which they can closely resemble, salmon have no spots on their adipose and tail fins.</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Landlocked Atlantic salmon can be found in several of Vermont’s cold, clear and well-oxygenated lakes including Lake Dunmore, Lake Champlain and Lake Memphramagog.</p>
<p>Additionally, salmon can be found in the Winooski River and Lewis Creek – both tributaries of Lake Champlain, the Clyde River, a tributary of Lake Memphramagog, and in Sucker Brook, a tributary of Lake Dunmore.</p>
<p>Other salmon fisheries include Lake Willoughby, Seymour Lake and Harriman Reservoir.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>While landlocked Atlantic salmon can be targeted year-round with a variety of presentations, trolling and fly fishing methods are generally most popular among anglers.</p>
<p>Commonly-used trolling lures include smelt-imitating stickbaits, spoons and flash baits.</p>
<p>Popular salmon flies, including weighted nymphs and smelt-mimicking streamers, are also used in rivers and lakes alike.</p>
<p>Target salmon in the spring in shallow water around shoals, reefs and shoreline rock outcroppings or points of land, and follow them out to deeper water as waters warm during the summer and salmon remain within their comfort zone of about 55° F.</p>
<p>A depth finder is a key piece of equipment for locating deep water salmon, and downrigger setups and lead core or wire lines are critical for reaching the proper depths while trolling.</p>

<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Largemouth bass are found throughout Vermont and are abundant in the many lakes and ponds the state has to offer. A few of the more well-known largemouth bass fisheries include lakes Champlain, Memphremagog, Bomoseen, St. Catherine, Morey, Fairlee and Sadawga, as well as the Connecticut River.</p>
<p>Additionally, numerous unpressured, smaller ponds and reservoirs offer exceptional largemouth bass fishing opportunities and are slowly gaining popularity among anglers.</p>

<a href="/node/457" title="Catch-and-Release">Check out Vermont’s Spring Catch and Release Bass Fishing Opportunities</a>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Largemouth bass are a cover-oriented fish and are most commonly caught by anglers fishing in or around aquatic habitat such as submerged vegetation, shoreline wood and rocks, boat docks, off-shore rock piles and man-made cover including bridge pilings, rock piers and cement walls.</p>
<p>When targeting largemouth bass, be sure to present your live bait or lure of choice adjacent to, or into, these various types of cover. Though seasonal fish movement can impact fish location throughout the year, it’s always a good bet to fish close to the aforementioned types of prime largemouth habitat.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A long, slender fish that has a large mouth, and dorsal and anal fins placed far to the rear. They have greenish gray flanks with several rows of irregular, yellowish-white bean shaped spots. Northern pike have scales only on the upper half of their gill covers, and their tail, dorsal, and anal fins have dark spots or blotches.</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Northern pike have thrived in many of Vermont’s fertile lakes, ponds and rivers. Notable pike fisheries include Lake Champlain, Otter Creek, Bristol Pond, Woodward Reservoir, Connecticut River and Lake Memphramagog, among others.</p>
<p>Similar to other fish species, healthy populations of northern pike can also be found in various small ponds throughout the state.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Northern pike are aggressive feeders and have a wide-ranging diet. Due to this aggressive nature, anglers are generally most-successful targeting northern pike with moving baits around shallow underwater vegetation.</p>
<p>Using baits that afford a fast, erratic retrieve allow an angler to efficiently cover large expanses of water and trigger reaction bites from feeding pike.</p>
<p>Additionally, live bait offerings such as large baitfish can be especially effective, and anglers should reference current Vermont regulations for rules regarding baitfish use.</p>
<p>Northern pike are also fairly active under the ice, and suspending a live or dead baitfish under a tip-up is a great way to target them in the winter.</p>

<strong>State Record:</strong>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Native to North American west coast waters, rainbow trout were introduced in Vermont in the 1800s. Their tail and flanks are heavily spotted with small, well-defined black spots, and their flank usually has a pink or reddish stripe, for which they are named.</p>
<p>While genetically identical, rainbow trout that leave their rivers and streams as juveniles and migrate downstream to the ocean or large lakes -- such as Vermont’s Champlain and Memphremagog -- are deemed “steelhead.” They occupy the deep open pelagic zones and grow to maturity before migrating back to rivers and streams to spawn.</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Rainbow trout inhabit many of Vermont’s clear and cold streams, rivers and lakes, and generally prefer faster water than brook and brown trout.</p>
<p>Notable Vermont rainbow trout fisheries include the Mettawee, Dog, White, Middlebury, Black and Saxton’s rivers, as well as Caspian Lake, Lake Champlain and Lake Memphramagog and their connecting tributary waters.</p>
<p>Additionally, rainbows – both wild and stocked populations – can be found in dozens of other cold, clear waterways throughout the state.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Like other members of the salmonidae family, rainbow trout can be successfully targeted with both live bait and artificial lures. Live bait selections such as earth worms, live minnows and fish eggs can all be effective choices for catching rainbow trout. On the artificial lure side, spinners, minnow plugs, spoons, jigs and various flies are also proven baits.</p>

<a href="/node/457" title="Catch-and-Release">Check out Vermont’s Spring Catch and Release Bass Fishing Opportunities</a>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Smallmouth bass, similar to largemouth bass, feed heavily on bottom-inhabiting crayfish, as well as a variety of baitfish including yellow perch, smelt and alewife, among others. They also feed on many types of insects. Using live-bait or lures that match or imitate these bait species will help you to be successful when targeting smallmouths.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to fish around prime smallmouth habitat that typically includes clean, rocky or gravelly bottom, ledge, sharp-drop offs, current breaks, off-shore islands and reefs, and rock piles both on and off-shore.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Walleye are the largest member of the perch family, which also includes yellow perch and sauger. They have a large, silvery eye, a milky belly and flanks that range from olive brown to golden-yellow.</p>
<p>Walleye can be differentiated from sauger, which they closely resemble, by their first dorsal fin which is dusky colored and spotless.</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Though not as wide-spread in Vermont as many other species of fish, populations of walleye can be found in Chittenden Reservoir, Lake Carmi, the Connecticut River, Island Pond, Salem Lake and Lake Champlain.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Three common set-ups for targeting walleye include:</p>
<ul><li>fishing a jighead tipped with a night crawler, minnow or leech</li>
<li>trolling or retrieving a spinner and crawler harness near the bottom anchored by a bottom-bouncing sinker, and</li>
<li>trolling or casting and retrieving a minnow-shaped crankbait.</li>

<p>Walleye tend to relate to sand, gravel or rocky bottom areas and will often use submerged weed edges and sunken trees or logs as cover from which they can ambush prey. Their eyes are very sensitive to light, so they are usually most active at night or in turbid water.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>One of Vermont’s favorite food dishes and common to waters throughout the state. A schooling fish, yellow perch have golden-yellow flanks with six to eight dark vertical bars and orange lower fins.</p>
<h3>Where to Fish</h3>
<p>Yellow perch, a preferred forage fish for walleye, northern pike and smallmouth bass, are abundant in many bodies of water across Vermont.</p>
<p>Well-known yellow perch fisheries include lakes Champlain, Carmi, Morey, Bomoseen and Memphremagog, Chittenden and Harriman reservoirs, and Berlin Pond and Otter Creek, though many other small lakes and ponds sustain healthy populations of this species.</p>
<h3>How to Fish</h3>
<p>Yellow perch can be found relating to various types of aquatic habitat including submerged weed beds, shallow and deep rock structure, sunken trees, logs and stumps, and shoreline cover including overhanging trees and docks. Additionally, perch often hang around man-made cover such as bridge pilings and piers.</p>
<p>One proven tip for locating perch around these types of cover is to find structure that is directly adjacent to deep water. Perch will often relate to quick, steep drops where deep water cuts close to underwater cover.</p>
<p>Anglers typically succeed in targeting these aggressive feeders with live bait such as worms and small minnows, or with artificial lures like small grubs, tubes, flies and spinners.</p>
<p>Yellow perch are the most popular target for Vermont’s winter anglers, who typically use small jigs tipped with maggots or perch-eyes to catch this abundant, tasty species.</p>
